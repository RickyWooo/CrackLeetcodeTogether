# My Top 100 Leetcode (With Explaination)

## Who might be interested in this repo

This repo is for those beginners, fresh to leetcode and be afraid of reading lots of code

## TL;DR

Instead of a tutorial or sth like that, I am building a  world, a world let me explore the beautiful of programming language, data structure and algorithm. 

A travel of self-talking and thinking.

A logbook recorded how I think.

This repository include my favorite leetcode question and the way I think. My principal is, write a snippet of readable code while the performance is great, too.

I sincerely hope you like it!

Feature: Shopping Cart
  As a Shopper
  I want to put items in my shopping cart

    Given I'm a logged-in User
    When I go to the Item page
    And I click "Add item to cart"
    Then the quantity of items in my cart should go up
